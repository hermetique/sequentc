sequentc
========

An implementation for the sequent calculus and some logics (IL, ILL for now)

`sequentc.hs` contains a minimal implementation of the sequent calculus. This may not be by-the-book yet, but it will be.
`ill.hs` contains the rules for intuitionistic linear logic.
`il.hs` extends il.hs with contraction and weakening to get intuitionistic logic

`main.hs` contains an example taken from [A Taste of Linear Logic (pdf)](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/lineartaste/lineartaste-revised.pdf) by Phil Wadler and its derivation.
